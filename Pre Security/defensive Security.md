# Defensive Security

## Overview
Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

- **User cyber security awareness**: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.  
- **Documenting and managing assets**: Know the systems and devices to manage and protect.  
- **Updating and patching systems**: Ensure computers, servers, and network devices are updated and patched against known vulnerabilities.  
- **Setting up preventative security devices**: Firewalls and IPS are critical â€” firewalls control traffic; IPS blocks traffic matching rules/signatures.  
- **Setting up logging and monitoring devices**: Proper logging/monitoring is essential for detecting malicious activity (e.g., new unauthorized devices).

There is much more to defensive security. We also cover the following related topics:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)  
- Threat Intelligence  
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Malware Analysis
